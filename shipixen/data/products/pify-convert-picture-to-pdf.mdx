## Product Overview

Say hello to Pify, the easiest way to turn your photos and images into polished PDFs! 

- Import Images: Select photos from your library, scan with your camera, or choose images from your files—Pify supports them all.

- Crop with Precision: Use the built-in crop tool to focus on exactly what matters. Remove backgrounds or unwanted parts before creating your PDF, so every page is clean and relevant.

- Privacy First: We value your privacy and understand the importance of keeping your personal files secure. That's why all the processing of your scans is done right on your own device. This means your private files stay just that—private. You can rest easy knowing your data is in your hands, and we aren't able to see or share it with anyone.

- Create PDFs Instantly: Convert your selected and cropped images into high-quality PDFs in just a few taps. Perfect for receipts, notes, homework, or any important image.

- Save & Share: Save your PDFs directly to your device or share them instantly via email, messaging apps, or cloud services. Sharing your documents has never been easier.
