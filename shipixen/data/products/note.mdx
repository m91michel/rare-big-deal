## Product Overview

Keep what you care most about in focus with this minimalist notes app & widget.

It’s like a pinned or sticky note in its own app, for goals, ideas, reminders, or to-do lists.

The app feels like just 1 note, but you can create up to 8 infinite pages.

It features beautiful typefaces.

There is extra spacing between lines.

You can mark lines by giving them a color, making them italic, or both.

You can also give pages custom names.

Each page is saved as a plain text file, either in iCloud Drive or only on your iPhone or iPad.

Text and links can be added to a page in the app from within other apps using the Share button.

You can add a widget to your Home Screen and Lock Screen that shows the last line you selected in the app or the line you pinned in the Home Screen widget.

A control lets you open the app from Control Center or your Lock Screen. You can also assign this control to your iPhone’s Action button.

An Apple Watch app and widget show the last line you selected in the app on your paired iPhone or the line you pinned in the app on your watch.


App Privacy:

There is no sign-in and no data is collected.

Your files are encrypted on your device using your device’s passcode when it’s locked or turned off.

If iCloud Backup is turned on for the app in Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > Storage > Backups > [Your Device], your app data is uploaded to iCloud.

If you want your files in iCloud Drive to be end-to-end encrypted, turn on Advanced Data Protection in Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > Advanced Data Protection.

If you have Share Analytics turned on in Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements, we receive App Analytics from Apple. This does not contain your app data or personally identify you.


More Features:

To add a new line, pull down when you are at the top of a page.

Easily move lines up ↑ or down ↓.

Quickly undo or redo changes.

Tap the ⋯ button above the keyboard for more actions, such as adding the date or inserting a line break.

Link or move lines to another page using the Quick Actions menu.

List markers (like ‘-’) and spaces you add at the start of a line automatically get added to a new line below it.

A URL scheme allows you to go directly to a page or to a specific line on a page.

Support for Apple Intelligence Writing Tools on compatible devices.

Multiple windows support on iPad.

Fully accessible with VoiceOver.


Gestures:

Swipe left or right on a page while editing to move the insertion point from word to word.

To move the insertion point on iPhone, touch and hold the space bar and move around while keeping your finger on the keyboard. To move the insertion point on iPad, touch 2 fingers down on the keyboard and move around while keeping them on the keyboard.

Swipe to the left with three fingers to undo or to the right to redo.

Tap on a page with three fingers to show a menu with undo, cut, copy, paste, and redo.
