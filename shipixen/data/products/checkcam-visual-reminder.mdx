## Product Overview

CheckCam — Visual Reminder is a minimalist camera app for life's small but important moments.

Capture temporary photos and videos that won’t clutter your main library.
Whether you’re checking the stove, saving a Wi-Fi code, or remembering where you parked — snap it, check it, and forget it.

Photos and videos stay inside the app.
Keep your Photos library clean. All captures live in an isolated gallery inside CheckCam and never mix with your regular media.

 Organized by time.
Media is grouped into sessions — 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, or 1 day — so it’s easy to see what belongs together and when it was captured.  Auto-delete with flexible timers.

Keep your gallery clean. 
Media is automatically deleted after 1, 7 or 30 days — you choose the lifespan based on how long the info stays relevant.

  Pinned items stay safe.
Mark important media with a pin to protect it from Auto-delete.
Perfect for information you need to keep a little longer.

 Photo and video capture.
Tap to capture a photo. Press and hold to record video. 

Smart reminders.
Set gentle notifications to remind yourself to capture what matters before you leave.

Minimalist and intuitive interface.
No cloud sync. No data collection. No ads.

Perfect for:
- People who double-check everything before leaving
- Professionals who need quick visual notes
- Minimalists who want a clutter-free phone
- Older adults who benefit from visual confirmation

CheckCam — Visual Reminder
Trust your memory — with a photo.
