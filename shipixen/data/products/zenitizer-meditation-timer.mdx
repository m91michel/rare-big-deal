FEATURE OVERVIEW: 

- Clean & simple meditation timer

- Calming soundscapes help you relax

- Interval bells remind you to focus on the present moment

- Detailed, meaningful meditation statistics allow you to observe trends

- Set your daily meditation goal and track your streak to stay motivated

- Daily reminder notifications help you stay on track

- Make meditation part of your daily routine: Smart Reminders can notify you based on Focus modes, workouts, location, wake up & alarms and much more!

- Full meditation history view allowing you to see, edit or log individual sessions and reflect on your journey

- Interactive and StandBy Widgets: start meditations right from your Home Screen or Lock Screen

- Apple Health: store and sync your mindful minutes

- Save your favorite timer settings as routines

- Always keep your meditations, streaks and custom routines in sync via iCloud

- Widgets and Apple Watch complications: your goal at a glance

- Control Center: quickly toggle your favorite meditations

- Dark & tinted app icons & widgets

- Don't worry about breaking your streak: one minute a day is enough (you only need to reach your goal to grow the streak, not to keep it)

- Easily log past meditations without recording a timer session (just went on a mindful walk? Quickly save 30 mindful minutes)

- Siri Shortcuts: start routines, log meditations and query your goal and streaks. Imagine the possibilities! How about an automation to start a meditation, enable a Focus mode and set a HomeKit scene with a single command?

- Privacy-friendly by design: health data is securely stored on your device and, if enabled, in Apple Health and iCloud (fully encrypted). Your data is never sold to anyone!

- Spotlight Integration: quickly start or log meditations and check your goal and streak


FREE & POWER USER FEATURES:

Many of the core features are available for free but some functionality requires Zenitizer+, which is available as a one-time purchase or subscription (you choose which plan fits best into your life - they all unlock the full feature set).

Zenitizer+ allows you to create and manage routines, access the growing catalog of bell and background sounds, manually log meditations and fully customize your meditation experience. By upgrading to Zenitizer+ you can take your meditation experience to the next level and allow an independent app developer to continue improving and maintaining Zenitizer for a long time to come :)
