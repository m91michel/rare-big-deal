## Product Overview

Capture's intuitive interface and smart features turn your mobile device into a powerful thought organizer, letting you seize, sort, and execute your ideas with unprecedented ease.

- Quick Notes: Immediacy is key, and with Capture, the moment inspiration hits, you're ready. Our quick note-taking feature is designed for those who think fast and want to write faster. Notes, lists, and reminders are captured in real-time, ensuring no idea ever slips through the cracks. Brain dump on the go and stay one step ahead of your inspiration.

- Export to 20+ apps: Looking to migrate your captures to other platforms like Obsidian, Things 3, Todoist, iA Writer, Craft, Omnifocus 4, Fantastical, UpNote, NotePlan, Reminders or Apple Calendar? Capture's export functionality allows you to move your content with ease. It's all about getting your thoughts out there, wherever 'there' might be, from to-do to calendar apps. In addition, you can run any Siri Shortcut as an export option, enabling all kinds of workflows by using the capture as input.

- iCloud Sync: Keep your ideas and tasks in harmony across all your devices with Capture's iCloud Sync. Every note, list, and preference is automatically updated, ensuring you have access to your latest thoughts wherever you go.

- Intuitive reminders: With our badge system, subtle yet effective reminders keep you informed of your tasks. These intuitive nudges ensure that important notes don't get lost in the shuffle, keeping you alert and on track.
