LifePace has SO. MANY. FEATURES, but here's the TLDR:
- Create and organize habits with smart schedules and reminders  
- One-tap tracking with streaks, haptics, and sounds
- You're human: skip an occurrence without breaking your record streak
- Optional "Hard mode" turns skips into misses, if you want to be strict

- Clear interface with summaries, statistics, graphs and easy navigation  
- Widgets, Lock Screen, Control Center and Apple Watch complications always at a glance  
- Private, secure iCloud sync across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. And absolutely no tracking, ads or analytics.

The free version of LifePace lets you fully explore all features while tracking 1 habit.
Upgrade to LifePace Pro to unlock unlimited habits and support the continued development of this indie app.
LifePace Pro is available as either a one-time lifetime unlock or a yearly auto-renewing subscription. Both options give you the same functionality, choose the commitment and purchase method that fits you best.
