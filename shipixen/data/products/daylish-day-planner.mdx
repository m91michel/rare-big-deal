## Product Overview

Daylish is your friendly day planner. It helps you never be late again, while effortlessly flowing through your day and getting things done. See all your calendar events, journeys, timers and alarms in a single unified timeline. Easily plan ahead with smart alarms and timers that assist you in getting ready well in advance of important events, taking into account travel and preparation time.

Quickly plan your whole day in just a few minutes, easily identifying where you need a little more buffer timer to avoid stressful situations, as well as finding gaps you can use for productivity, relaxation and fun!

Once you made your plan, just flow from one time block to another. Stay focused on what matters now, instead of worrying about what lies ahead. Daylish will keep you on track when the time comes and always lets you see at a glance what's happening right now and coming up next.


ALARMS FOR EVENTS

Traditionally, calendar apps show notifications, which is great (and also something Daylish supports) but sometimes you just need that extra buzz to grab your attention and that's why Daylish allows you to create ALARMS that are linked to calendar events or any other timeline items. You definitely won't miss that important meeting anymore - even when you're totally in the zone!


LEAVE ON TIME

With Daylish's Leave On Time routines you can quickly block time for the journey as well as the time you need to get ready to leave the house. When your preparation time starts, you will get an alarm that you cannot miss. Once dismissed, it will automatically transform into a countdown timer, telling you how much time you have to get out of the house. Of course, this is visible as a Live Activity, so you can always do a quick time check while you're getting ready to head out.

The journey and preparation time blocks are linked to the calendar event. That means: if you move the calendar event in Daylish, everything else is automatically updated as well.


FOCUS TIMERS & ROUTINES

Use timers for focus work sessions or chores that fit neatly between your events or build your custom morning routine with multiple sequential timers. The possibilities are endless.


FREE & POWER USER FEATURES

Many of the core calendar and agenda features are available for free, but some functionality (alarms, timers and smart routines as well as advanced filters and settings) require Daylish+, which is available as a one-time purchase or subscription (you choose which plan fits best into your life - they all unlock the full feature set).

By unlocking Daylish+ you gain access to features that make you more productive and help you be on time and stay on track. Also, you're supporting an independent developer and helping me to keep working on Daylish for a long time to come - thank you! :)
