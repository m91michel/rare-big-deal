## Product Overview

Transform your iPhone and iPad into a powerful multi-page document scanner with OCR and versatile automation. SendScan combines a best-in-class scanner with text recognition and workflows that send your documents exactly where they need to go, automatically.

SendScan is really fast and integrates with iCloud with absolute privacy. 
You can scan a document and then share it, or start directly from a workflow that first scans the document and then perform a series of actions you configure (i.e. rename, send via email to your accountant, share via Messages and then delete).

SCAN ONCE, AUTOMATE EVERYTHING

Stop wasting time on repetitive tasks after scanning. Create custom workflows that automatically:

- Save to specific folders: Route documents to the right place instantly
- Email directly: Send scans to clients, colleagues, or yourself with pre-filled subjects and messages *; multiple recipients are supported and you can either type in their address or pick from your device's Contacts
- Share via Messages: Like for email, add recipients and share via Messages automatically *
- Share seamlessly: Use the system share sheet to send documents anywhere
- Rename intelligently: Apply naming patterns with timestamps, dates, and custom tokens
- Chain actions: Combine multiple steps into a single tap
- Optionally delete after the workflow completes

* A confirmation tap before sending is required by iOS.

OCR & SEARCHABLE PDFs

Make your scans searchable and extract text automatically, privately on-device:

- Searchable PDFs: Enable automatic OCR to create PDFs with invisible, selectable text layers with per-word accurate position in search
- Text extraction: Every OCR'd scan includes a companion .txt file for easy text access
- TXT viewer: View and search recognized text with highlighting and font controls
- Share plain text: Quickly share extracted text without the PDF
- Manual OCR: Add text recognition to existing PDFs with one tap
- Workflow integration: Automatically attach .txt files when emailing or sharing
- Quality control: Save as PDF (multi-page) or JPG (one per page) with adjustable quality and compression

WIDGETS, SHORTCUTS & QUICK ACTIONS

Scan and run workflows without opening the app:

- Home Screen widgets: One-tap access to your most-used workflows
- Recent documents widget: See thumbnails of your latest scans
- Lock Screen widgets: Scan from your Lock Screen
- Control Center: Add scanning to your quick actions
- App icon Quick Actions: Long-press the app icon to scan or run pinned workflows
