## Product Overview

Hey there! After countless late-night coding sessions and way too many cups of coffee, I'm excited to share Basket with you – my take on making grocery shopping less of a headache.

You know that feeling when you're standing in the store, trying to remember if you needed milk, while juggling a messy paper list? Yeah, been there! That's exactly why I built Basket. It's not trying to be the fanciest app out there (trust me, I had to stop myself from adding 47 different features), but it does one thing really well – keeping your shopping lists simple and actually useful.

What makes Basket special?

- Multiple Lists: Because sometimes you need different lists for different places (and no, storing them in Notes isn't the best solution – I learned this the hard way!)
- Lightning-Fast Input: Add items quickly, because life's too short to navigate through complex menus
- Clean, Distraction-Free Design: Just your lists, without the clutter (took me weeks to remove features you probably won't need)
- Smart Organization: Group items your way – by store, by list, or however makes sense to you
- Easy Sharing: Share lists with family (because my partner kept "forgetting" to check the app)

Built with heart & coffee in Phnom Penh by an indie developer who probably spent too much time debating whether the 'Add' button should be blue or green (it's neither, by the way).

As a solo developer, every download and review means the world to me. I'm actively working on making Basket better based on your feedback – because hey, this app is as much yours as it is mine!

P.S. If you find yourself actually enjoying making grocery lists with Basket, my mission is accomplished!

Give it a try – your future self, standing in the grocery store with a clear plan, will thank you!
