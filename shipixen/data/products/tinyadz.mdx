  Google, Facebook, and the rest? Total garbage. They’re built for VC-funded startups burning cash, happy to lose $10 for every $5 they make. Screw that.   I got sick of the scams, bots, fake clicks, zero returns. So I built a better ad network. No fluff, no fraud. Advertisers get real ROI. Publishers earn legit revenue. It’s advertising that works for everyone.
